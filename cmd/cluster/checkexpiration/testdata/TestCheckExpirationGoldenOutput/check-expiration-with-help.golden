  check-certificate-expiration [flags]

To display all the expiring entities in the cluster
# airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration --kubeconfig testconfig

To display the entities whose expiration is within threshold of 30 days
# airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration -t 30 --kubeconfig testconfig

To output the contents to json (default operation)
# airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration -o json --kubeconfig testconfig
or
# airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration --kubeconfig testconfig

To output the contents to yaml
# airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration -o yaml --kubeconfig testconfig

To output the contents whose expiration is within 30 days to yaml
# airshipctl cluster check-certificate-expiration -t 30 -o yaml --kubeconfig testconfig


Flags:
  -h, --help                 help for check-certificate-expiration
      --kubeconfig string    path to kubeconfig associated with cluster being managed
      --kubecontext string   kubeconfig context to be used
  -o, --output string        convert output to yaml or json (default "json")
