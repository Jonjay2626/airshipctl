## airshipctl document plugin

Run as a kustomize exec plugin

### Synopsis

This command is meant to be used as a kustomize exec plugin.

The command reads the configuration file CONFIG passed as a first argument and
determines a particular plugin to execute. Additional arguments may be passed
to this command and can be used by the particular plugin.

CONFIG must be a structured kubernetes manifest (i.e. resource) and must have
'apiVersion' and 'kind' keys. If the appropriate plugin was not found, the
command returns an error.


```
airshipctl document plugin CONFIG [ARGS] [flags]
```
